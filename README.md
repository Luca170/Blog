# Blog
A blog made up with Mongoose, express, passportJS. I should have used also nodemailer but it didn't have so much sense, so I just left the option but not programmed because it fitted best with the design of the site but it doesn't work. To post you have to be logged, you can choose to log with your facebook/google accounts or with an account created at the moment, in case in the sign up page you insert registered credentials, these won't be saved and you will be redirected to the login page, if you use credentials never used before they will be saved and you will be reidrected in the login page, if you sign up with facebook/google you will go automatically to the logged page. Now you can log the blog page where you can createa  a post or see every post, if the post are made by you, you can change or delete them.It's overall responsive. You can't access the logged page or any blog page if you aren't logged in first, the site will throw error or will redirect you in the home page
In the code repository I will not add the .env file
